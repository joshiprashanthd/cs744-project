# Publisher-Subscriber Platform

This project aims at designing and implementing a publisher-subscriber platform that acts as a message broker for communication between distributed services. The platform exposes API endpoints which the services can use to send and receive messages.

## Development Environment

To set it up on your machine, simply run the below command

```
    make run
```

This will compile all the dependencies and source files into an executable "main" and place it in the "bin" directory and run the application.
You also need to have mongodb instance running on your machine for the platform to function properly.
